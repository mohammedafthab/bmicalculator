		<h3>What is BMI?</h3>
		<p>
		Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.	
		</p>
		<p>
			A body mass index in the low range signals that you could be malnourished. Maybe your body isn’t properly absorbing nutrients or maybe you’re just not getting enough calories to support your activity level. Conversely, having a BMI on the higher end alerts your physician that your risks of heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers are higher than someone with a normal BMI. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Now let's check your BMI
